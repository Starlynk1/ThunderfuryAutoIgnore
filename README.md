# Thunderfury Auto Ignore

Originally designed as a way for me to remove and block those that spam useless crap just because it's an annoying thing for others. 
As I've used it, I decided that it needed more functionality for all those spam related things that become a nuisance.

TFA intercepts chat messages before they are seen and removes the message. At the same time, it will block that player for a chosen period of time. Default time is 24 hours which is the max time unless permanently ignored.

Default setup has the Thunderfury phrase and link ignored. This can be removed in the options and re-added at any time using the 'Add Thunderfury' button.

## Usage

You can use the GUI config dialog or the slash commands /tfa options

*   /tfa - show ignore list
*   /tfa options - open settings panel
*   /tfa enable - turn on auto-ignore
*   /tfa disable - turn off auto-ignore
*   /tfa add Name - manually add a player
*   /tfa remove Name - remove a player from DB
*   /tfa sync - re-sync DB to this character
*   /tfa verify - check if permanent ignores still exists
